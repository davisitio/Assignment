                <h1>How the <a href="#" class="fade_in_bg">MAGIC</a> was created</h1>
                <article><p>The Burger Factory was founded by <a href="#" class="underline_from_center">David Henao</a> in 2016. David wanted to make sure everytime someone ate a burger, it would make the world a little better. There have been many claims about the origin of the hamburger. There is a reference to a "Hamburg steak" as early as 1884 in the Boston Journal.On July 5, 1896, the Chicago Daily Tribune made a highly specific claim regarding a "hamburger sandwich" in an article about a "Sandwich Car": "A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range." According to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. As far as were concerned, burgers began, and will end with <a href="#" class="underline_from_center">The Burger Factory.</a></p></article>
